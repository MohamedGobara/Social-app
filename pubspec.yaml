# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - lib/my_images/photo_2021-07-03_21-04-52.jpg
   - lib/my_images/17techhearing-facebookpreview-mediumSquareAt3X.jpg
   - lib/my_images/undraw_Notify_re_65on.png
   - lib/my_images/—Pngtree—social network_5413579.png
   - lib/my_images/undraw_Login_re_4vu2.png
   - lib/my_images/sign_up.png

   - lib/my_images/template.jpg
   - lib/my_images/undraw_not_found_60pq.png
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: PlayfairDisplay
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/fonts/PlayfairDisplay-Black.otf
        - asset: lib/fonts/PlayfairDisplay-BlackItalic.otf
        - asset: lib/fonts/PlayfairDisplay-BoldItalic.otf
        - asset: lib/fonts/PlayfairDisplay-Bold.otf
        - asset: lib/fonts/PlayfairDisplay-Italic.otf
        - asset: lib/fonts/PlayfairDisplaySC-Regular.otf
    - family: MyIcons
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/icons/my_icons.ttf
    - family: MyFlutterApp
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/icons/MyFlutterApp.ttf
